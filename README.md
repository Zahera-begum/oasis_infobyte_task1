A BMI calculator using Python refers to a program written in the Python programming language that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is a measure of body fat based on a person's weight and height. It's a simple calculation, typically done using the formula:

\[BMI = \frac{weight(kg)}{height(m)^2}\]

Python, being a versatile programming language, allows developers to create such calculators efficiently. With Python, you can create a command-line tool, a web application, or even a graphical user interface (GUI) for a BMI calculator. This program would typically take user input for weight and height, perform the calculation, and then display the BMI result.
